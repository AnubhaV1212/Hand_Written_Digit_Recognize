# Hand_Written_Digit_Recognize

## Overview
This is a end to end digit recongnizer desktop application project. The trained model is used to predict the draw image of digit 0-9. You need to draw the digit and then click on Click Button, it will show the digit with prediction percentage.

## Motivation
I had start learning deep learning as well with Machine learning. So deploying my first deep learning model. 

## Technical Aspect
There are two technical aspect
First, after getting data I have prepare the model using RandomForestRegressor algorithm.
Second, after developing model. I have deployed my application on desktop using Tkinter
